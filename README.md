The inventory app I developed was designed to help users efficiently manage and track items, integrating features like user authentication, CRUD operations, and SMS notifications for important updates. To support user needs, I created a clear and intuitive UI with a grid layout for easy item viewing, a login screen for secure access, and forms for adding and deleting inventory items. My UI design focused on simplicity and accessibility, ensuring users could navigate the app with minimal effort. During development, I prioritized clean, well-organized code by implementing modular functions and proper commenting, which made debugging and scalability easier. I tested the app extensively through Android Studioâ€™s emulator and manual input validation, which helped catch errors. Testing was crucial in ensuring a smooth user experience and preventing crashes. One of the biggest challenges was integrating database functionality while maintaining UI responsiveness, but breaking the problem into smaller tasks helped me tackle it efficiently. I was particularly successful in implementing database interactions, demonstrating my understanding of data persistence, SQL queries, and user input handling. These skills will be valuable in future projects as I continue refining my approach to mobile app development.
